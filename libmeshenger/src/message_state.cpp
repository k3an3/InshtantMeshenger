/* Message state */

/* The class should have a zero argument constructor
 * and use some sort of efficient data structure
 * to store a list of messages that have been seen
 *
 * It should only keep a certain number of messages,
 * then start kicking out old ones to make room
 * for new ones. This should be doable with some
 * added public methods.
